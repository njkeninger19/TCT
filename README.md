# TCT
Work done on the Topological Constraint Theory Project by Nathaniel Keninger for the Coe College Physics Department. Python scripts build structural models and extrapolate properties such as Glass Transition Temperature and Liquid Fragility. This work currently covers the Alkali Borate and Silicate families of glasses, and is able to be expanded to any other glass system, given a structural model is able to be constructed. See paper for further details on the process.
